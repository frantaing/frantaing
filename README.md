I'm a Computer Science student and VtM nerd. Frontend is my ~~prison~~ passion and I love recreating websites and doing frontend-adjacent projects.

- 🎓 Soon to be graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science from Mapúa University.
- 💻 My main playground: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, and React**.
- 🩸 Currently working on VtM tools and probably more frontend.
- 🌱 My personal quest: A fully green contribution chart! This way, I can finally know the feel of grass...

### 💫 What I'm Working On

- **[Schrecknet Lite](https://github.com/frantaing/schrecknet-lite)**: A web-based character sheet tool for V20, built with vanilla JS and Tailwind CSS. 
- **[VtM NPC Progression Tool](https://github.com/frantaing/vtm-npc-progression)**: A Python TUI app using `curses` to quickly stat out NPCs by allocating freebie points based on age (or you can just go wild with unlimited points).
- **[VtM Character Vault](https://github.com/frantaing/vtm-character-vault)**: A website built with React, that works as a centralized repository of my VtM characters. Built with React.
- **[Blasted Glass](https://github.com/frantaing/blasted-glass)**: A weird UI/website storage container monorepo that's also kind of my portfolio. Built with Svelte.
- **[gh-helper](https://github.com/frantaing/gh-helper)**: A TUI tool, build with `gum` and `gh`, for doing Github things the website won't let you do via `github-cli`.

### ✨ Check out some recreates!

- **[Monstercat Album Rlease Page](https://github.com/frantaing/monstercat-page-recreate)**: A recreate of [Monstercat's Level Days album release page](https://www.monstercat.com/release/MCLP017), complete with a music player!
- **[Monogram Shop Page](https://github.com/frantaing/monogram-shop-recreate)**: A recreate of [Monogram's shop page](https://monogramcc.com/shop/), with all its sidebars, dropdowns, and cool cross-fade hover-animation for product items.
- **[Backstage Talks Page](https://github.com/frantaing/backstagetalks-recreate)**: A recreate of [Backstage Talk Magazine's website](https://backstagetalks.com/), with its cool scroll-snapping and background color changes.
